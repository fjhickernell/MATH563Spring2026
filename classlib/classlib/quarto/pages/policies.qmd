## Accommodations for Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and make an appointment to speak with me, Fred Hickernell, as soon as possible. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3424 S. State St., room 1C3-2 (on the first floor), telephone 312-567-5744 or disabilities@illinoistech.edu.

## Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information

Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process.

You can report sexual harassment electronically at iit.edu/incidentreport, which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@illinoistech.edu. For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@illinoistech.edu or (312)567-7550.

## Academic Integrity, Technology, and AI Usage

You are **encouraged** to use technology, including AI tools like ChatGPT, to explore ideas and complete assignments or projects, as long as you understand the work and can explain it yourself. On tests and the final exam, no technology or AI will be allowed unless I say otherwise. Always use these tools to support your learning, not to replace it, and give credit if they meaningfully contribute to your work.

Students are expected to uphold the highest standards of honesty in their academic work, in accordance with Illinois Tech’s Code of Academic Honesty.

### Permitted Use

- **Assignments & Projects:** You are encouraged to use technology and AI tools to assist in problem-solving, exploring concepts, and checking work.
- You must critically evaluate AI-generated content for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
- You are responsible for understanding and being able to explain any work produced with technological assistance.

### Prohibited Use

- **Tests & Final Exam:** No technology, AI tools, or external resources may be used unless explicitly allowed by the instructor.
- Submitting AI-generated or technological outputs without personal understanding is prohibited and will be treated as a violation.

### Citations & Transparency

If you use AI tools, software, or other external resources in a way that significantly shapes your work, you must acknowledge it (e.g., “Approach suggested by ChatGPT”).

### Consequences

Violations will be handled according to Illinois Tech’s Code of Academic Honesty.
