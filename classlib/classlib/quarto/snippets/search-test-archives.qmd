## 🔎 How to search the archives (PDFs) for keywords

Goal: find which past exams mention a term (e.g., Brownian, Sobol, CLT) *inside* PDF test and exam files.

The folder `assets/tests/archive` in the course repository contains subfolders for archived tests from past semesters for MATH 476, MATH 563, and MATH 565. The subfolders are the course numbers, e.g., `archive/563` for MATH 563 tests.

### Mac (Homebrew) / Linux

__One-time setup (install pdfgrep):__

```bash
brew install pdfgrep
```

__Each time you want to search the archive:__

- Navigate to the root of your local course repository root, then run:

```bash
cd assets/tests
```

- Use one of the following commands to search the archives:

Search *all archives in this repo*:

```bash
pdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive
```

Search *one specific archive folder*:

```bash
pdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive/563
```

Search *multiple archives at once*:

```bash
pdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive/476 archive/563
```

Examples:

```bash
pdfgrep -rniH -C2 'brownian' archive
pdfgrep -rniH -C2 'sobol' archive
pdfgrep -rniH -C2 'central limit|CLT' archive
```

### Windows (recommended: WSL)

On Windows, the recommended approach is to use **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**, which lets you run the same commands as Mac/Linux users.

After installing WSL (e.g., Ubuntu):

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/path/to/course-repo/assets/tests
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pdfgrep
pdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive
```

If you prefer not to use WSL, note that Windows does not include a native equivalent of `pdfgrep`; setup and commands vary by third-party tools.
