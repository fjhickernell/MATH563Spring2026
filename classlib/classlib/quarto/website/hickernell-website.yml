# HickernellClassLib/classlib/quarto/website/hickernell-website.yml
#
# PURPOSE
# -------
# This file defines SHARED WEBSITE LAYOUT SETTINGS only.
# It is imported via `metadata-files` into course repositories.
#
# WHAT BELONGS HERE
# -----------------
# - format.html layout options
# - grid widths
# - theme
# - toc settings
# - typography / structural knobs
#
# WHAT MUST NOT BE HERE
# ----------------------
# - website: (navbar, page-footer, title)
# - site-specific metadata
# - asset paths (css, images, logos)
# - absolute or relative file paths
#
# WHY
# ---
# Asset paths defined here are resolved relative to the current page,
# which can break when pages live at different directory depths or when
# deployed to GitHub Pages project sites.
#
# All CSS, logo paths, and other file references must be defined in the
# project-level `_quarto.yml` of each course repository.
#
# If styling breaks:
#   1. Check the course repo `_quarto.yml`
#   2. Do NOT add paths here
#
# This file should remain path-free and project-agnostic.
