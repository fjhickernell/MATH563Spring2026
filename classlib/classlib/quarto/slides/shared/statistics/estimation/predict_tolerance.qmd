# Beyond Confidence Intervals

So far, our intervals have targeted a [population parameter]{.alert} such as mean, $\mu$$, or variance, $\sigma^2$


But in practice, we may want to answer different questions:

1. Where is the true mean? [confidence interval]{.alert}
2. Where will the next observation fall? [prediction interval]{.alert}
3. Does most of the population lie within specifications? [tolerance interval]{.alert}

These require different kinds of intervals, and different calculations

## Large Sample Confidence Interval (Review)

Under the CLT,

$$
\frac{\bar X - \mu}{S/\sqrt{n}} \approx N(0,1)
$$

So a 95% confidence interval for $\mu$ is

$$
\bar X \pm z_{0.975}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}.
$$

- Targets the parameter $\mu$  
- Shrinks as $n$ increases  
- Says nothing directly about future observations
