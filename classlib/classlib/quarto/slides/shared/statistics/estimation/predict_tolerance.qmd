# Beyond Confidence Intervals

So far, our intervals have targeted a [population parameter]{.alert} such as mean, $\mu$, or variance, $\sigma^2$


But in practice, we may want to answer different questions:

1. Where is the true mean? [confidence interval](#ci_review)
2. Where will the next observation fall? [prediction interval](#prediction_interval)
3. Does most of the population lie within specifications? [tolerance interval](#tolerance_interval)

These require different kinds of intervals, and different calculations

## Large sample *confidence* interval (review) {#ci_review}

Under the CLT, a $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $\mu$ is

$$
\Prob \left[ \bar X - z_{\alpha/2}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} \le \mu \le \bar X + z_{\alpha/2}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} \right] = 1-\alpha 
$$

- Targets the parameter $\mu$  
- Shrinks to zero width as $n$ increases  
- Says _nothing_ directly about future observations

## Large sample *prediction* interval (Normal data) {#prediction_interval}

Suppose $X_1,\dots,X_n,X_{n+1}$ are IID $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, and we want to predict a *new* observation:

$$X_{n+1} 
=
(X_{n+1} - \mu)
-
(\barX_n - \mu) + \barX_n$$

in relation to $\barX_n$. Note that

$$
\var(X_{n+1} - \barX_n)
= 
\sigma^2 + \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
=
\sigma^2\left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)
$$

since $X_{n+1}$ and $\barX_n$ are independent. Thus, a $100(1-\alpha)\%$ prediction interval for $X_{n+1}$ is

$$
\Prob\left( \barX_n - z_{\alpha/2}\, S \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{n}} \le X_{n+1} \le \barX_n + z_{\alpha/2}\, S \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{n}} \right) = 1-\alpha
$$

- Targets a future observation $X_{n+1}$

- Does _not_ shrink to zero width as $n$ increases  


## Large sample *tolerance* interval for $\Norm(\mu,\sigma^2)$ data (different again) {#tolerance_interval}

Assume $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$. Sometimes the question is:

> Can we say that at least 95% of the population lies within an interval?

A $(1-\alpha,\gamma)$ **tolerance interval** consists of random endpoints
$X_-$ and $X_+$ such that

$$
\Prob\!\left[
\Prob(X_- \le X \le X_+) \ge 1-\alpha
\right]
=
\gamma
$$

- The inner probability is taken over the population distribution of $X$
- The outer probability is taken over repeated samples used to compute
  $X_-$ and $X_+$

--- 

For $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, the central $1-\alpha$ proportion of the population is
$\mu \pm z_{\alpha/2}\sigma$

So a $(1-\alpha,\gamma)$ tolerance interval is approximately

$$
\Prob \left [\Prob \left( \barX_n - z_{\alpha/2} S
\sqrt{
1+\frac{z_\gamma^2}{2n}} \le X \le \barX_n + z_{\alpha/2} S \sqrt{1 + \frac{z_\gamma^2}{2n}} \right) \ge 1-\alpha  \right ] = \gamma
$$


- Targets population coverage
- Does not shrink to zero width
- Is typically wider than a prediction interval

## Comparison of interval half-widths

| Interval type | Half-width |
| ------ | --- |
| Confidence interval for $\mu$ | $\displaystyle z_{\alpha/2} \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}$ |
| Prediction interval for $X_{n+1}$ | $\displaystyle z_{\alpha/2} S \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{n}}$ |
| Tolerance interval for $1-\alpha$ coverage | $\displaystyle z_{\alpha/2} S \sqrt{1 + \frac{z_\gamma^2}{2n}}$ |
