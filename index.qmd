## Assessment

- **Homework:** 15%  
- **Midterm Tests:** 25%  
- **Project:** 20%  
- **Final Exam:** 40%  
- **Extra Credit:** up to 10%<br>
  Beginning January 20, if you are the first to find an error in
    - My lecture slides, Jupyter Notebooks, or assignments at least 24 hours after I have presented them in class, or
    - The textbook,

  Then I will award you 0.5 or 1 extra credit points, up to a maximum of 10 points.  
  
  For course materials hosted on GitHub, you may submit a pull request correcting the error. Alternatively, you may report the error by email with sufficient detail. Extra credit points are added to your final weighted total. _Note that the weighted total may not correctly reflect the extra credit until grades are recorded for all categories._
