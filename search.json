    "text": "Instructions for Tests and Exams\nUnless otherwise noted\n\nTests are closed book, but you may use four letter-sized sheets of notes (both sides) handwritten or typed as you please; no sharing of notes during the test\nCalculators and other electronic devices are not allowed; phones must be placed in your bags under your desks or at the front of the room; hands must be on top of your desks\nYou are expected to simplify any expressions that can be simplified as even numbers, but you may leave other expressions as is, e.g., \\(\\sqrt{47}\\) or \\(18/29\\)\nYou will be provided all of the critical values that you need and are not expected to memorize them, but you should know how to use them\nShow all your work to justify your answers; answers without adequate justification will not receive credit\nYou will be asked to sign an integrity statement on the question paper, and you are expected to abide by it\n\n\n\nThis semester’s tests and exams\nDates, coverage, and PDFs for this semester will appear here as they become available.\n\n\n\nDate\nAssessment\nPDF\n\n\n\n\n\nThu Feb 26\nTest 1\nTest 1 Questions and Answers\n\n\n\nThu Apr 7\nTest 2\nTest 2 Questions and Answers\n\n\n\nTue May ?\nFinal Exam\nFinal Exam Questions and Answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip🔎 How to search the archives (PDFs) for keywords\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: find which past exams mention a term (e.g., Brownian, Sobol, CLT) inside PDF test and exam files.\nThe folder assets/tests/archive in the course repository contains subfolders for archived tests from past semesters for MATH 476, MATH 563, and MATH 565. The subfolders are the course numbers, e.g., archive/563 for MATH 563 tests.\n\nMac (Homebrew) / Linux\nOne-time setup (install pdfgrep):\nbrew install pdfgrep\nEach time you want to search the archive:\n\nNavigate to the root of your local course repository root, then run:\n\ncd assets/tests\n\nUse one of the following commands to search the archives:\n\nSearch all archives in this repo:\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive\nSearch one specific archive folder:\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive/563\nSearch multiple archives at once:\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive/476 archive/563\nExamples:\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'brownian' archive\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'sobol' archive\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'central limit|CLT' archive\n\n\nWindows (recommended: WSL)\nOn Windows, the recommended approach is to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which lets you run the same commands as Mac/Linux users.\nAfter installing WSL (e.g., Ubuntu):\ncd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/path/to/course-repo/assets/tests\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install pdfgrep\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive\nIf you prefer not to use WSL, note that Windows does not include a native equivalent of pdfgrep; setup and commands vary by third-party tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nMATH476 563FinalS11Answers\nMATH563Test1S11Answers\n\n\n\n\n\nArchive from MATH 476 (related material)\n\n\n\nMATH476FinalExamS10Answers\nMATH476FinalS11Answers\nMATH476StatFinalS06Answers\nMATH476StatTestS06Answers\nMATH476StatTestTwoS06Answers\nMATH476Test1S10Answers\nMATH476Test1S11Answers\nMATH476Test2S10Answers\nMATH476Test2S11Answers\nMATH476Test2S11MakeUpAnswers\nMATH476Test2v2S10Answers"

Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.\nIllinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process.\nYou can report sexual harassment electronically at iit.edu/incidentreport, which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@illinoistech.edu. For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@illinoistech.edu or (312)567-7550."

The subfolders are the course numbers, e.g., archive/563 for MATH 563 tests.\n\nMac (Homebrew) / Linux\nOne-time setup (install pdfgrep):\nbrew install pdfgrep\nEach time you want to search the archive:\n\nNavigate to the root of your local course repository root, then run:\n\ncd assets/tests\n\nUse one of the following commands to search the archives:\n\nSearch all archives in this repo:\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive\nSearch one specific archive folder:\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive/563\nSearch multiple archives at once:\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive/476 archive/563\nExamples:\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'brownian' archive\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'sobol' archive\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'central limit|CLT' archive\n\n\nWindows (recommended: WSL)\nOn Windows, the recommended approach is to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which lets you run the same commands as Mac/Linux users.\nAfter installing WSL (e.g., Ubuntu):\ncd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/path/to/course-repo/assets/tests\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install pdfgrep\npdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive\nIf you prefer not to use WSL, note that Windows does not include a native equivalent of pdfgrep; setup and commands vary by third-party tools."
