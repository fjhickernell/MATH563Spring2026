title: "Project"

You are required to complete a course project. The goal is to practice communicating statistical ideas clearly and critically—like you are reporting to colleagues whether a line of work is worth pursuing.

## Types

Choose **one** of the following project types:

- **Research article review**  
  Pick a scholarly research article related to topics in *statistical inference* (e.g., estimation, testing, likelihood/Bayes, asymptotics, bootstrap, identifiability, robustness, missing data, multiple testing, etc.) _that does not duplicate a topic discussed in class. Your article must be different from your classmates’ choices.

- **Simulation or data analysis study**  
  Design and carry out a focused study that uses computation to investigate a statistical question. Examples:
  - Analyze a data set of interest, but go beyond any existing analysis,
  - Compare procedures (power, bias, coverage, MSE) under realistic departures from assumptions,
  - Illustrate a theorem/asymptotic approximation with finite-sample behavior,
  - Replicate and critique an empirical claim from a paper,
  - Build a small method “pipeline” (e.g., model selection + inference) and evaluate it.

## Submission

- Submit your **project topic** using the [topic submission form](https://forms.office.com/r/QmZSDmcXKx) by **Friday, March 6, 2026**.
- After the topic deadline, check the posted **topic list** &lt;To Be Announced&gt;  to confirm approval.
- Prepare a **15-minute oral presentation** (+5 minutes for questions) and a **handout** for the audience.

## Presentations and observations

- Project presentations will be scheduled near the end of the semester &lt;To Be Announced&gt;.
- **Each student must observe and assess TWO other presentations** (using the [Project Assessment Form](project-assessment.qmd)).
- Your project grade is likely to **suffer** if:
  - you are not on time for your presentation or observations,
  - you are not prepared,
  - you do not observe at least **two** presentations, and/or
  - your observer feedback is not significant.

## Important to keep in mind

Your presentation should be from the perspective that you are reporting to your colleagues why this article/method/result is or is not worth pursuing further.

- Your audience is smart, but *not specialized in your exact topic*. Provide background, definitions, and motivation.
- Be critical: clearly state strengths *and* weaknesses, and what assumptions matter.
- You have access to tools (including AI) that were not commonly available a few years ago—so I will expect more polish and deeper checking.
- I may not be an expert in what you present, but I expect **you** to be, and I will ask probing questions.
- Your grade will depend on both:
  - how clearly you present, and
  - how well you answer questions.

## Guidelines

- **Article review.**
  - Choose a topic not already covered in lecture in essentially the same way.
  - Prefer papers with enough technical content to support real discussion (not just an application report).
  - Your job is to explain the *idea*, demonstrate it on a simple example, and assess it.

- **Simulation/data study.**
  - Keep the scope appropriate: one sharp question is better than many shallow ones.
  - Predefine your evaluation metrics (e.g., coverage, power, MSE, false discovery rate).
  - Use clear plots/tables and report uncertainty when relevant.

General presentation advice:

- Keep the big picture in view; don’t get bogged down in algebra.
- Choose one simple example that illustrates the main point.
- Look at your audience while speaking; do not read your notes.
- Motivate your talk: background, prior work, and why anyone should care.
- Discuss pros/cons and failure modes.
- Don’t use too many slides; about **one per minute** is usually enough.
- Don’t overload slides; prioritize figures/tables over dense text.
- Include key formulas/figures directly in your slides rather than making the audience hunt in the paper.
- Use your **own words**. Do not plagiarize.
- Practice beforehand. Time yourself.
