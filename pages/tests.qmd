## Archived tests and exams

These older tests may resemble current assessments, but topics and emphasis change from year to year.
There may be typos in these tests; I appreciate hearing about them, but no extra credit is awarded for old-test typos.

## 🔎 How to search the archive (PDFs) for keywords

Goal: find which past exams mention a term (e.g., Brownian, Sobol, CLT) inside PDF files.

### Mac (Homebrew) / Linux

```bash
brew install pdfgrep
cd /path/to/your/local/repo/assets/tests
pdfgrep -rniH -C2 'your term here' archive/563
```

Examples:
```bash
pdfgrep -rniH -C2 'brownian' archive/563
pdfgrep -rniH -C2 'sobol' archive/563
pdfgrep -rniH -C2 'central limit|CLT' archive/563
```
:::

### Archive

```{python}
from pathlib import Path

root = Path("assets/tests/archive/563")

if not root.exists():
    print("*No archived tests found yet.*")
else:
    pdfs = sorted(root.glob("*.pdf"), key=lambda p: p.name.lower())
    if not pdfs:
        print("*No archived tests found yet.*")
    else:
        for p in pdfs:
            href = "/" + str(p).replace("\\", "/")
            label = p.stem.replace("_", " ")
            print(f"- [{label}]({href})")
```
